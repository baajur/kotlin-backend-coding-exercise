**Bayzat Backend Coding Excercise**
  
Welcome! In this excercise, you are asked to develop a simple RESTful service.<br>
The service will provide functionality to create, read, update and delete certain entities, namely: Company, Employee, Dependant.<br>
Companies can have multiple employees and employees can have multiple dependants. Furthermore, they have the specific attributes:</p>

**Company**
• Name<br>
• Address</p>

**Employee**
• Name<br>
• Phone number<br>
• Gender<br>
• Date of birth<br>
• Salary</p>

**Dependant**
• Name<br>
• Phone number<br>
• Gender<br>
• Date of birth<br>
• Relation to employee</p>

**Notes**
• Use Symfony Framework (PHP) or Spring Boot (any jvm language).<br>
• Expose a REST API, no frontend is required.<br>
• Usage of kotlin will be considered a plus.<br>
• Usage of API Blueprint will be considered a plus.<br>
• Proper unit testing and coverage will be considered a plus.<br>
• Improvise where details are omitted.</p>
